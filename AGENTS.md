# AGENTS.md — farm

## What this is

A desktop-first browser idle farming game: the player plans and expands a small top-down pixel farm while tiny autonomous farmhands plant, water, harvest, haul, and sell crops. Inspired by cozy idle farm toys, but with its own implementation and visual identity.

Stack: Vite + TypeScript + civ-engine + Phaser + Vitest. The simulation is deterministic and testable; Phaser renders sprites and camera movement; DOM overlays render the HUD, toolbars, side panels, and settings surfaces.

Desktop-first: do not add mobile-specific scope unless the user asks.

## Fleet constitution

- Verify visual work visually: capture the rendered result — screenshot, frame, recording — and look at it, because a passing test says nothing about what the pixels do. Work with no visual surface runs headlessly.
- Commit each verified unit of change to `main` without being asked, and push. Gates pass before any commit that touches code; a dependency change re-runs the audit gate.
- A repo chooses its own language and toolchain — Node, Python, and Rust all run here. Each pins its version where its own tooling reads it (`.nvmrc`, `requires-python`, `rust-toolchain.toml`) and names it in Gates, so a version mismatch is not read as a code failure. Node repos baseline at 24; an older major keeps a CI job proving it.
- Runtime model calls are authorized and already paid for — this fleet has one user, with Claude Code and Codex subscriptions — so a program here may call a model at runtime, vision included.
- The top reasoning tier is rationed: spend it only on the hardest problem, or on directing the workhorse tier that does the work — and only at maximum effort or orchestration.
- High-risk work — persistence/migrations, security/auth, concurrency, money, supply chain, edits that reach sibling repos — escalates to the multi-cli-review skill. That is a review you run yourself, not permission you ask the user for; nothing in this canon requires asking.
- Error messages are a product surface: audit them as a class, including paths the task did not touch. Each names what happened, which input caused it, and what would satisfy it — context the throw site holds for free and a reader can only buy back by running it again. That detail is what closes the loop: a bare `Validation failed` turns an already-diagnosed failure into a debugging session.
- When blocked, hand over the raw artifact — screenshot, rendered page, log line, data row — as soon as the blocker is named rather than after the analysis: your description of it is filtered through the misunderstanding that caused the block, so it cannot contain what you failed to notice.
- Task-run evidence lives only under ignored paths and is deleted once nothing active needs it; it enters Git only when review promotes it into a repository input — a fixture, golden, snapshot, or contract. Tracked docs keep conclusions and provenance only. Blob ceilings for anything promoted: over 256 KiB needs a stated reason, over 512 KiB binary or 1 MiB of anything never enters ordinary Git, and an asset store or LFS needs the user's approval.
- Write prose one line per paragraph (no hard wrapping).
- Keep a devlog: one short dated line per behaviour-changing session in `docs/devlog/summary.md`, newest first, and a section in `docs/devlog/detailed/` for anything a later session could trip over — what was believed and proved false, what a reviewer caught that the author missed, what number moved and from what. Both shapes are in `../fleet/docs/devlog-template.md`. It is history, not status: the repo's design docs hold the current position. Write it because the alternative is rediscovering your own dead ends.
- Read `docs/learning/lessons.md` at session start: the one-line index of what this repo has already paid to learn, short by construction, with each entry's war story and anchor in `lessons-evidence.md` — opened only when a rule is in doubt or the work is in that area. A lesson lands the session it is learned, as an entry there plus one line here, anchored to a measurement, commit, or test id; unanchored, it is folklore. When a lesson becomes a gate — a test, a lint rule, a fixed command — delete both halves, because the machine enforces it now and every line that stays spends the attention that keeps the rest read. Shape: `../fleet/docs/lessons-template.md`.
- Steering compounds: a direction that outlives the immediate task lands that same session — `../fleet/FLEET.md` if fleet-wide, else this repo's `docs/policies/local-rules.md` — and you say where it went.
- Reviewer model pins live only in `../fleet/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md`; a model a product itself calls is pinned in the repo that calls it. Never hardcode a model ID anywhere else.

## Gates

`npm test` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm run lint` · `npm run build` — all four before every code commit; smallest meaningful check while iterating. Dependency audit gate: `npm audit --audit-level=high` (full tree and `--omit=dev`).

## Session start

Read `docs/devlog/summary.md` and `docs/architecture/architecture.md` before starting work.

## Invariants & boundaries

- Layout: `src/game/simulation` (civ-engine world, commands, systems, state projection) · `src/game/content` (crops, tiers, prices, starting map, tuning constants) · `src/phaser/scenes` (scene orchestration only) + `src/phaser/view` (sprite, camera, tile rendering helpers) · `src/ui` (DOM HUD, toolbar, panels) · `src/persistence` (localStorage save/load boundary) · `src/debug` (render_game_to_text and structured debug helpers) · `src/annotations` (annotation selection/capture model) · `tests/` (headless simulation contracts plus browser, phaser, persistence, and annotation suites).
- `game/simulation/` owns game rules, entities, inventory, crops, workers, milestones, and saveable state. Phaser scenes contain no gameplay rules — they read projected snapshots and submit typed commands. DOM UI never mutates simulation state directly — it submits commands through the same bridge as hotkeys and canvas input. Save files contain serializable simulation state, not renderer objects.
- TDD for deterministic simulation and user-facing contracts: write or update the failing test first, watch it fail, then implement the smallest passing change.
- Gameplay numbers live in `src/game/content/` — no magic numbers scattered through systems.
- Files under 500 LOC (hard ceiling 1000) — split god-objects by lifecycle/role before they become hard to scan.
- Expose `window.render_game_to_text()`, `window.advanceTime(ms)`, and `window.__farmDebug.getState()` for automated playtesting.
- Do not ship a visual feature without browser evidence (screenshot or Playwright verification); check that text fits and UI elements do not overlap at desktop and smaller desktop-like viewport sizes.
- If an external CLI reviewer is unavailable for high-risk work, proceed with the in-process adversarial pass and record the limitation in the devlog.
