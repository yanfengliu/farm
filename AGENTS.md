# AGENTS.md — farm

## What this is

A desktop-first browser idle farming game: the player plans and expands a small top-down pixel farm while tiny autonomous farmhands plant, water, harvest, haul, and sell crops. Inspired by cozy idle farm toys, but with its own implementation and visual identity.

Stack: Vite + TypeScript + civ-engine + Phaser + Vitest. The simulation is deterministic and testable; Phaser renders sprites and camera movement; DOM overlays render the HUD, toolbars, side panels, and settings surfaces.

Desktop-first: do not add mobile-specific scope unless the user asks.

## Fleet constitution

- Work headlessly by default; go non-headless only when nothing else can complete or verify the task, and say why. Close every browser or GUI process the task opened.
- Concurrent sessions share one worktree and one index: commit by explicit pathspec (`git commit -- <files>`), never `git commit -a`, `git add -A`, or `git add .` — a sweeping commit captures whatever another session has staged. (Evidence: voxel c024b33, 2026-07-17.)
- Commit each verified unit to `main` promptly and push at the end of the task; never commit failing or partial work as a checkpoint. The repo's gates pass before every commit that touches code; doc-only changes need a self-reviewed diff. Dependency changes re-resolve the lockfile and run the audit gate — a new HIGH/CRITICAL is a blocker.
- Toolchain baseline: develop and run gates on Node 24, which every Node repo pins in its own `.nvmrc`. A repo that must keep supporting an older major says so in its Gates section and keeps a CI job proving it, because otherwise an agent on the wrong version reads a version failure as a code failure and starts debugging the repo. (Established 2026-07-31, after `node:check` failed on Node 22 and looked like a broken checkout.)
- A model call is a legitimate component of a program here, not only an authoring aid: this fleet has one user, with Claude Code and Codex subscriptions, so a pipeline may call a model at runtime — vision included — wherever that beats a hand-written heuristic. Model output proposes, a deterministic check disposes, and it never self-certifies. Reaching for a brittle heuristic to avoid a model call is the mistake, not the other way round. (Established 2026-07-31, after a geometric stud-pitch reader answered 4 of 50 booklet regions and a headless vision call answered 6 of 6.)
- Never claim a bug fixed from a code diff. Rerun the failing case and compare at bug-class granularity, then promote the fix with a regression test or fixture that fails if it reverts — a fix with no way to catch the class again is incomplete.
- When two attempts at the same problem have failed, stop iterating alone: build the fixed benchmark or reproduction that settles the question, fan out independent subagents on deliberately different approaches against it, then switch role to evaluator — score their output yourself rather than trusting their reports, and take the best. A third pass at the approach that already failed twice is the expensive mistake. (Established 2026-07-31.)
- High-risk work — persistence/migrations, security/auth, concurrency, money, supply chain, edits that reach sibling repos — escalates to the multi-cli-review skill. Reviewers must read the live code; verify their claims against the codebase before acting on them, and weigh substantive findings over approval votes.
- Error messages are a product surface, audited as a class rather than fixed when one happens to be touched: every path that rejects, fails, or throws says what happened, which specific input caused it, and what would satisfy it — never a bare `Validation failed` or a silent boolean false. Where a failure has known non-fixes, name the dead end too. (Established 2026-07-18 after city's `placeService` answered five rejected placements with only "Validation failed"; widened to coverage 2026-08-01 after voxel's Riverfall surface told three sessions running to "increase particle coverage" when coverage was the one thing measured not to fix it.)
- Docs are part of the change: update every affected surface in the same commit, write prose one line per paragraph (no hard wrapping), and never reference or mandate files that don't exist. Lessons files (`docs/learning/lessons.md` where present) require evidence anchors — source, fix commit, test id, behavior delta; unanchored lessons are folklore.
- Steering compounds: when the user gives a direction that generalizes past the immediate task, land it in the canon in that same session — `../fleet/FLEET.md` if it is fleet-wide, otherwise this repo's `docs/policies/local-rules.md` — so the next run inherits it instead of relearning it, and say what was captured and where. (Established 2026-07-18.)
- Research before you reason: when a question has a public answer — a physics or numerical method, a library's behaviour, an engine's parameter, a format, a protocol — read the docs, the source, or the literature before deriving it, and cite what you read so the next reader can check instead of re-deriving. A dependency's source is one call away (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<path>`). Do not reinvent a method that has a name, and never explain a measured result with a mechanism you have not checked. (Established 2026-08-01, after a voxel session measured that Rapier's soft CCD was inert for a rotating cam and guessed the mechanism right, then in the same comment asserted a 45 Hz contact frequency "cannot be represented" at a 1/60 s step — the engine's own erp formula saturates smoothly and has no such limit.)
- Reviewer model pins live only in `../fleet/docs/skills/multi-cli-review.md`; a model a product itself calls is pinned in the repo that calls it. Never hardcode a model ID anywhere else.

## Gates

`npm test` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm run lint` · `npm run build` — all four before every code commit; smallest meaningful check while iterating. Dependency audit gate: `npm audit --audit-level=high` (full tree and `--omit=dev`).

## Session start

Read `docs/devlog/summary.md` and `docs/architecture/architecture.md` before starting work. Read `docs/learning/lessons.md` too — it records what has already been tried and what it cost, and a lessons file nothing tells anyone to open is write-only.

## Invariants & boundaries

- Layout: `src/game/simulation` (civ-engine world, commands, systems, state projection) · `src/game/content` (crops, tiers, prices, starting map, tuning constants) · `src/phaser/scenes` (scene orchestration only) + `src/phaser/view` (sprite, camera, tile rendering helpers) · `src/ui` (DOM HUD, toolbar, panels) · `src/persistence` (localStorage save/load boundary) · `src/debug` (render_game_to_text and structured debug helpers) · `src/annotations` (annotation selection/capture model) · `tests/` (headless simulation contracts plus browser, phaser, persistence, and annotation suites).
- `game/simulation/` owns game rules, entities, inventory, crops, workers, milestones, and saveable state. Phaser scenes contain no gameplay rules — they read projected snapshots and submit typed commands. DOM UI never mutates simulation state directly — it submits commands through the same bridge as hotkeys and canvas input. Save files contain serializable simulation state, not renderer objects.
- TDD for deterministic simulation and user-facing contracts: write or update the failing test first, watch it fail, then implement the smallest passing change.
- Gameplay numbers live in `src/game/content/` — no magic numbers scattered through systems.
- Files under 500 LOC (hard ceiling 1000) — split god-objects by lifecycle/role before they become hard to scan.
- Expose `window.render_game_to_text()`, `window.advanceTime(ms)`, and `window.__farmDebug.getState()` for automated playtesting.
- Do not ship a visual feature without browser evidence (screenshot or Playwright verification); check that text fits and UI elements do not overlap at desktop and smaller desktop-like viewport sizes.
- If an external CLI reviewer is unavailable for high-risk work, proceed with the in-process adversarial pass and record the limitation in the devlog.
